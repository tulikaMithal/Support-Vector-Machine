# Support-Vector-Machine

Objective: given a set of executables, classify them into malicious and benign.

The code implements linear support vector machine.

Input parameters: training dataset, actual target class value of training data and test dataset.

Training dataset: consists of samples of malicious and benign executables. 2000 bigrams are used as features. Target class value is '1' for malware and '-1' for benign samples. 

Output: Gives output '1' or '-1'
